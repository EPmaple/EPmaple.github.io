This website, created for Destiny Child's gamers group named AGE, is to display data of past Ragna Seasons, which includes member counts, 
slime counts, and zoom counts.

Static HTML files produced using Jinja2 templates, formatted by CSS, functionality provide by JavaScript, and hosted with Github Pages.

This is still a work in progress.
